# Amazing Electron.NET

## Prepare

1. install node
1. install electron

## Build

At the first time, you need an Electron.NET project initialization. Type the following command in your ASP.NET Core folder:

``` bash
dotnet electronize init
```

If you have had `electronnet.manifest.json` in your project, execute the  following command directly

``` bash
dotnet electronize start
```
